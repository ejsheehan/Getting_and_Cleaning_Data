# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data
Course Project

The run_analysis.R script conatins the run_analysis() function. The function takes no 
arguments. 

The data used in this analysis was obtained from the UC Irvine Human Activity Recognition
Using Smartphones Data Set. The link to the data is 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. 
It is assumed that the function is run from the same working directory as the one from which
which the files were downloaded.

When run, the function results in a tidy dataset containing the average value of each 
mean and standard deviation measurement, grouped by subject and by activity.
